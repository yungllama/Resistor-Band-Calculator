# Resistor-Band-Calculator
This program is written in C++ for a user to input the amount of bands, its order of its color to calculate its total resistances.
It can calculate between 3 - 6 bands and computes the total resistance of such resistor.
This program follows theoretical caluclations so resistance that may  not exist in life, can still be calculated!
